# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Motivation for creating this study guide was to have a place to easily access the main points of the prework for the bootcamp. This website was built in order to learn the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, git and JavaScript and to aid in revision. The project solves the problem of not knowing which topic to study first and keeps notes in one place making them easy to read and look back on.
